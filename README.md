# TS2_Editor
A modding tool for the gamecube version of TimeSplitters 2.
It changes values in the ISO so it's best to always have a backup in case something doesn't go as planned.
I got the offsets through the documentation about modding weapons from this guy:
https://timesplitters.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Dude30500
The documentation also states that trying to load projectiles that are not usually used in story levels will crash the game,
so just have one ISO for playing arcade and one for story I suppose.
